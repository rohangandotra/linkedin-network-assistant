# Collaboration Feature Setup Instructions

## Overview
The collaboration feature enables users to:
- Connect with other users
- Search each other's networks
- Request warm introductions
- Manage introduction requests

## Step 1: Run Database Schema

1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy the entire contents of `collaboration_schema.sql`
6. Paste into the SQL editor
7. Click **Run** button
8. Verify success - you should see "Success. No rows returned"

## Step 2: Verify Tables Created

In the SQL Editor, run these queries to verify:

```sql
-- Check user_connections table
SELECT * FROM user_connections LIMIT 1;

-- Check intro_requests table
SELECT * FROM intro_requests LIMIT 1;

-- Check if organization column was added
SELECT id, email, full_name, organization FROM users LIMIT 5;
```

You should see empty tables (no error messages).

## Step 3: Test Row Level Security (RLS)

The schema includes RLS policies to ensure users can only see their own data. Verify they were created:

```sql
-- View policies for user_connections
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'user_connections';

-- View policies for intro_requests
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'intro_requests';
```

You should see policies for SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE operations.

## Step 4: Local Testing

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Create test accounts:**
   - Create Account #1:
     - Name: Test User 1
     - Organization: Test Company A
     - Email: test1@example.com
     - Password: test123

   - Create Account #2:
     - Name: Test User 2
     - Organization: Test Company B
     - Email: test2@example.com
     - Password: test123

3. **Test Connection Flow:**
   - Login as User 1
   - Upload a CSV with contacts
   - Go to **Connections** page
   - Click "Find People" tab
   - Search for "Test User 2"
   - Send connection request
   - Logout

   - Login as User 2
   - Upload a different CSV with contacts
   - Go to **Connections** page
   - Click "Pending Requests" tab
   - Accept User 1's request
   - Check "Share my network" checkbox

4. **Test Extended Network Search:**
   - Stay logged in as User 2
   - Go to main app page
   - Scroll to "Extended Network Search" section
   - Search for someone from User 1's contacts
   - Click "Request Intro"
   - Fill out request form
   - Submit

5. **Test Intro Requests:**
   - Logout and login as User 1
   - Go to **Intro Requests** page
   - Click "Received Requests" tab
   - You should see User 2's intro request
   - Click "Accept & Generate Intro Email"
   - Review AI-generated email
   - Mark as sent

## Step 5: Deploy to Production

1. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add collaboration feature: connections, extended search, intro requests"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify Streamlit Cloud deployment:**
   - Streamlit Cloud will automatically redeploy
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
   - Visit your app URL

3. **Test on production:**
   - Create a new account
   - Upload contacts
   - Test connection flow
   - Test extended search

## Features Overview

### 1. Connections Page (pages/Connections.py)
- **My Connections**: View and manage connections
- **Find People**: Search users by name/organization
- **Pending Requests**: Accept/decline connection requests
- **Network Sharing**: Toggle sharing per connection

### 2. Intro Requests Page (pages/Intro_Requests.py)
- **Sent Requests**: Track intro requests you've made
- **Received Requests**: Manage requests to make intros
- **AI Email Generation**: Auto-generate intro emails
- **Status Tracking**: pending/accepted/declined/completed/cancelled

### 3. Extended Network Search (main app)
- Search contacts from connected users' networks
- Request introductions with context
- See whose network each contact is in

## Database Schema

### user_connections
- Tracks connections between users
- Statuses: pending, accepted, declined
- Network sharing permission per connection
- Bidirectional relationships

### intro_requests
- Tracks introduction requests
- Stores target contact details (survives deletion)
- Auto-cancels if contact deleted (trigger)
- Statuses: pending, accepted, declined, completed, cancelled

## Privacy & Security

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only access their own data
- **Network Sharing Control**: Users choose who sees their network
- **Per-Connection Permissions**: Toggle sharing individually
- **Contact Deletion Protection**: Requests auto-cancel if contact deleted

## Troubleshooting

### "relation does not exist" error
- SQL schema wasn't run properly
- Re-run `collaboration_schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### RLS policy violations
- Check if RLS policies were created
- Run: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename IN ('user_connections', 'intro_requests');`

### Organization field missing
- Run: `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organization VARCHAR(255);`

### Contacts not showing in extended search
- Check network_sharing_enabled is TRUE
- Verify connection status is 'accepted'
- Check both users have uploaded contacts

### Intro request not appearing
- Check connector_id matches actual user ID
- Verify connection exists and is accepted
- Check RLS policies allow user to see request

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] SQL schema runs without errors
- [ ] New users can register with organization
- [ ] Users can search for each other
- [ ] Connection requests can be sent/accepted/declined
- [ ] Network sharing toggle works
- [ ] Extended network search finds contacts
- [ ] Intro request form submits successfully
- [ ] Intro requests appear in receiver's page
- [ ] AI generates intro emails
- [ ] Requests can be accepted/declined
- [ ] Contact deletion cancels pending requests
- [ ] RLS prevents unauthorized access

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Send email when connection request received
   - Notify when intro request received
   - Notify when intro request accepted/declined

2. **In-App Notifications**
   - Badge count for pending requests

   - Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
   - Save searches

4. **Analytics**
   - Connection growth over time
   - Intro request success rate
   - Network overlap visualization

5. **Granular Contact Sharing**
   - Share specific contacts instead of entire network
   - Tag-based sharing (share only "investors", etc.)

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 â†’ Console tab)
2. Check Streamlit logs for backend errors
3. Verify database connection in Supabase dashboard
4. Review RLS policies are correctly set up
