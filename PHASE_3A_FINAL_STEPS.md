## üöÄ Final Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Update Streamlit Cloud Secrets

Your Streamlit Cloud deployment needs the SMTP email configuration to send password reset and verification emails.

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud:** https://share.streamlit.io/
2. **Find your app:** `linkedin-network-assistant`
3. **Open Settings:** Click ‚öôÔ∏è Settings ‚Üí Secrets
4. **Verify these secrets exist** (they should already be there from your initial setup):
   ```toml
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-actual-key"
   SUPABASE_URL = "your-actual-url"
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your-actual-key"
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY = "your-actual-key"
   ```

5. **Add these NEW email secrets** (copy exact values from `.streamlit/secrets.toml`):
   ```toml
   SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.gmail.com"
   SMTP_PORT = 587
   SMTP_USERNAME = "noreply.6thdegree@gmail.com"
   SMTP_PASSWORD = "ctzxnfhhlnqegepf"
   FROM_EMAIL = "noreply.6thdegree@gmail.com"
   APP_URL = "https://linkedin-network-assistant.streamlit.app"
   ```

6. **Click Save**

### Step 2: Trigger Deployment

**Streamlit Cloud will auto-deploy** since you pushed to the main branch.

To monitor deployment:
1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Click on your app
3. Check the **Logs** tab to see deployment progress
4. Wait ~2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

**OR manually trigger reboot:**
1. Click ‚ãÆ (three dots) ‚Üí **Reboot app**

### Step 3: Test Security Features

Once deployed, test each feature:

#### Test 1: Password Reset ‚úÖ
1. Go to https://linkedin-network-assistant.streamlit.app/
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter: `rohan.gandotra19@gmail.com`
4. Check your email for reset link
5. Click link and set new password
6. Log in with new password

#### Test 2: New User Registration ‚úÖ
1. Click "Create New Account"
2. Fill in form with a test email you can access
3. Submit registration
4. Check email for verification link
5. Click verification link
6. Try to log in (should require verification)

#### Test 3: Rate Limiting ‚úÖ
1. Try to log in with wrong password 5 times
2. On 6th attempt, should see: "Too many login attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes."

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending?

**Check Streamlit Cloud logs:**
```
1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Click your app ‚Üí Logs
3. Search for "Email sent" or "SMTP"
```

**Test SMTP locally:**
```bash
cd ~/prd-to-app
python3 -c "
import security
result = security.send_email(
    'rohan.gandotra19@gmail.com',
    'Test Email from LinkedIn Network Assistant',
    '<h1>Test Email</h1><p>If you receive this, SMTP is working!</p>',
    'Test Email'
)
print('Email sent:', result)
"
```

### App Won't Start?

**Check for errors:**
```bash
cd ~/prd-to-app
python3 -m py_compile app.py security.py auth.py
python3 -c "import app, security, auth; print('All modules OK')"
```

---

## üìä Verification Commands

**Check security tables in Supabase:**
```bash
cd ~/prd-to-app
python3 check_security_schema.py
```

**List all users:**
```bash
python3 list_users.py
```

**Check specific user:**
```bash
python3 check_users.py
```
