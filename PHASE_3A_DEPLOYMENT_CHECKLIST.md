## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Update Streamlit Cloud Secrets

1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Find your app: `linkedin-network-assistant`
3. Click **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets**
4. Verify/add the following secrets (one line per key):

```toml
# Copy these values from your .streamlit/secrets.toml file
# DO NOT commit actual secrets to GitHub!

OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key-here"

SUPABASE_URL = "your-supabase-url-here"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your-supabase-anon-key-here"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY = "your-supabase-service-key-here"

# Email Configuration
SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT = 587
SMTP_USERNAME = "your-smtp-username@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASSWORD = "your-gmail-app-password-here"
FROM_EMAIL = "your-from-email@gmail.com"

APP_URL = "https://linkedin-network-assistant.streamlit.app"
```

**NOTE:** Use the actual values from your local `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file. The values should match what's in your local environment.

5. Click **Save**

**CRITICAL:** Make sure there are NO line breaks within the secret values!

---

### Step 2: Commit and Push Changes to GitHub

The security features are already in your git repo, but let's add the new test files:

```bash
cd ~/prd-to-app

# Add new files
git add check_security_schema.py
git add PHASE_3A_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
git add PHASE_3B_SEARCH_PLAN.md

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Commit
git commit -m "Add Phase 3A deployment checklist and verification tools"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

**Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)**
- Streamlit Cloud auto-deploys when you push to main branch
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
- Go to https://share.streamlit.io/ to check deployment status

**Option B: Manual Reboot**
- Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
- Find your app
- Click **‚ãÆ** ‚Üí **Reboot app**

---

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

Once deployed, test each security feature:

#### ‚úÖ Test 1: Registration with Email Verification
1. Go to https://linkedin-network-assistant.streamlit.app/
2. Click "Create New Account"
3. Fill in registration form with a valid email you can access
4. Submit registration
5. Check your email for verification link
6. Click verification link
7. Verify you see "Email verified successfully" message
8. Try to log in

**Expected:** Email verification required before accessing app features

#### ‚úÖ Test 2: Password Reset Flow
1. Go to login page
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter your email
4. Check your email for reset link
5. Click reset link
6. Enter new password (test password strength validation)
7. Submit new password
8. Try to log in with new password

**Expected:** Password reset successfully, can log in with new password

#### ‚úÖ Test 3: Rate Limiting
1. Try to log in with wrong password 5 times
2. On 6th attempt, verify you see rate limit message

**Expected:** "Too many login attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes."

#### ‚úÖ Test 4: Password Strength Validation
1. Try to register with weak password: "123"
2. Verify you see password strength error

**Expected:** Password must be at least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and numbers

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
**Issue:** Verification/reset emails not arriving

**Check:**
1. Verify SMTP credentials in Streamlit Cloud secrets
2. Check spam/junk folder
3. Verify Gmail app password is correct
4. Check Supabase logs for errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test SMTP locally
cd ~/prd-to-app
python3 -c "
import security
result = security.send_email(
    'your-test-email@gmail.com',
    'Test Email',
    '<h1>Test</h1>',
    'Test'
)
print('Email sent:', result)
"
```

### Rate Limiting Not Working
**Issue:** Can attempt login unlimited times

**Check:**
1. Verify `login_attempts` table exists in Supabase
2. Check if `check_login_rate_limit()` is being called

**Fix:**
- Review app.py:1129-1132 to ensure rate limiting code is present
- Check Supabase for login_attempts records

### Email Verification Not Required
**Issue:** Users can log in without verifying email

**Check:**
1. Verify `email_verified` column exists in users table
2. Check app.py:1141-1155 for verification check

## üìä Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Check Security Events
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM security_events
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check Login Attempts
```sql
SELECT email, success, attempted_at
FROM login_attempts
ORDER BY attempted_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check Password Reset Usage
```sql
SELECT user_id, created_at, used, used_at
FROM password_reset_tokens
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
